# ZaQQ: A Novel Automatic Arabic Essay Scoring Dataset

This repository contains the `ZaQQ` dataset, a novel resource for Automated Essay Scoring (AES) in Arabic. `ZaQQ` is designed to address the critical scarcity of labeled Arabic essay datasets, leveraging a human-AI collaboration framework to generate multidimensional assessments across seven writing criteria: Relevance, Organization, Vocabulary, Style, Development, Mechanics, and Structure.

## Dataset Overview

`ZaQQ` is an expanded dataset built upon existing Arabic essay collections, `QCAW` (It contais essays, and `QAES` the trait results for QCAW), `ZAEBUC` and QALB, by applying a systematic LLM-based annotation framework. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and high-quality resource for developing robust Arabic AES systems.

### Writing Criteria

The essays in `ZaQQ` are scored across the following seven traits, each on a scale of 1-5 (except Relevance, which is 1-2):

1.  **Relevance (REL):** How well the essay addresses the prompt/topic.
2.  **Organization (ORG):** The logical structure and coherence of the essay.
3.  **Vocabulary (VOC):** The richness, appropriateness, and accuracy of word choice.
4.  **Style (STY):** The clarity, fluency, and overall writing voice.
5.  **Development (DEV):** The depth and elaboration of ideas and arguments.
6.  **Mechanics (MEC):** Grammatical correctness, spelling, and punctuation.
7.  **Structure (GRA/STR):** Sentence structure and overall composition.

## Data Sources

The `ZaQQ` dataset is an augmentation of the following publicly available Arabic essay datasets:

### 1. QCAW/QAES

* **Description:** The QCAW (Qatari Corpus of Argumentative Writing) contains the raw essay texts. QAES refers to the trait-specific scoring results that were generated for these QCAW essays. This dataset, comprising QCAW essays and their QAES scores, is the first trait-specific Arabic dataset with multi-layer annotations and includes detailed analytical scoring rubrics.

### 2. ZAEBUC

* **Description:** The ZAEBUC dataset offers a bilingual Arabic-English approach with CEFR proficiency labels and includes valuable writer metadata. It is particularly useful for cross-lingual transfer learning studies.

### 3. QALB Corpus

* **Description:** The second QALB Corpus (2015) primarily focuses on grammatical error correction and categorizes detailed error types. For `ZaQQ`, topics were generated for this dataset to enable trait-based assessment.
* **Note:** We removed 8 redundunt essays from 622 essays as they were too small.

## `ZaQQ` Dataset Content

The `ZaQQ.csv` file, provided alongside this README, contains the expanded and annotated Arabic essays. Each entry includes:

* The original essay information; metadata from the orignal datasets (ZAEBUC, QALB) so you can merge each essay from orignal dataset to its result in our dataset.
* The automatically generated scores for each of the seven writing traits.
* The generated topics for QALB essays.

The `Dataset_Sample.xlsx` file, provided alongside this README, contains sample data from the three datasets used:

* **QAES & QCAW**: publicly available  
* **QALB**: essays are from the dataset; topics and scores taken from ZaQQ  
* **ZAEBUC**: essays and topics are from the dataset; scores taken from ZaQQ
